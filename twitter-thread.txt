============================================

TWEET 1 (Hook):
---------------
We built "git for prompts"

Not because we wanted to.
Because managing 50+ LLM prompt versions in Google Docs was breaking our production AI.

Introducing PIT (Prompt Information Tracker) 🕳️

pip install prompt-pit

Here's what 332 tests and 10 features taught us 🧵

TWEET 2:
--------
1/ Prompt Bisect 🔍

Your AI started giving weird answers. Which version broke it?

pit bisect start --failing-input "why is the sky blue?"
pit bisect good v1
pit bisect bad v50

Binary search finds the culprit. Minutes, not hours.

---

TWEET 3:
--------
2/ Time-Travel Replay ⏰

Same input. 50 versions. Instant comparison.

pit replay run my-prompt --input "Hello" --all

See exactly how your prompt's behavior evolved. No more "it worked yesterday" mysteries.

---

TWEET 4:
--------
3/ Shareable Patches 📦

Your teammate improved a prompt. You want that improvement.

pit patch create prompt v1 v2 --output fix.patch
pit patch apply fix.patch --to my-prompt

Like git patches, but for prompt semantics. Distribute improvements like code.

---

TWEET 5:
--------
4/ Query Language 🔎

Find versions that actually matter:

pit log --where "success_rate > 0.9"
pit log --where "content contains 'be concise' AND tags contains production"

Query by behavior. Not just metadata.

5/ Git-Style Hooks ⚙️

Prevent bad prompts from reaching production:

pit hooks install pre-commit
# Scans for security issues before every commit

CI/CD for prompts. Finally.

---

TWEET 7:
--------
6/ Dependencies 📎

Your prompts depend on other prompts. Track it:

pit deps add shared github org/repo/prompts --version v1.0
pit deps install

Like npm for prompts. Version-lock your dependencies.

• Bisect (find broken versions)
• Replay (time-travel inputs)
• Patches (share changes)
• Hooks (CI/CD for prompts)
• Bundles (package & share)
• Query language (search by behavior)
• Dependencies (prompt packages)

• Semantic merge (smart conflicts)

All open source. 332 tests.

TWEET 9 (CTA):
--------------
PIT is free. Open source. Production-ready.

pip install prompt-pit

If you manage LLM prompts, this saves you hours every week.

Plus it has ASCII art banners 🎨
